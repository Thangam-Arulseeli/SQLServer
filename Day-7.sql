/*SQL indexes
An index is a schema object. 
It is used by the server to speed up the retrieval of rows by using a pointer. 
It can reduce disk I/O(input/output) by using a rapid path access method to locate data quickly. 
An index helps to speed up select queries and where clauses, but it slows down data input, 
with the update and the insert statements. 
Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data. 
For example, if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, 
you first refer to the index, which lists all the topics alphabetically and 
is then referred to one or more specific page numbers. */

--CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index ON TABLE column;
--Unique indexes are used for the maintenance of the integrity of the data present 
--in the table as well as for the fast performance, 
--it does not allow multiple values to enter into the table. 

/*When should indexes be created ? 
 
A column contains a wide range of values
A column does not contain a large number of null values
One or more columns are frequently used together in a where clause or a join condition
When should indexes be avoided ? 
 
The table is small
The columns are not often used as a condition in the query
The column is updated frequently*/

/*Types of indexes in SQL Server
SQL Server Indexes are divided into two types. They are as follows:
Clustered index
Non- clustered index*/

/*The Clustered Index in SQL Server defines the order in which the data is physically stored in a table. 
In the case of a clustered index,  the leaf node store the actual data. 
As the leaf nodes store the actual data a table can have only one clustered index. 
The Clustered Index by default was created when we created the primary key constraint for that table. 
That means the primary key column creates a clustered index by default.
When a table has a clustered index then that table is called a clustered table.
If a table has no clustered index its data rows are stored in an unordered structure.*/

 /*In SQL Server Non-Clustered Index, the arrangement of data in the index table 
 will be different from the arrangement of data in the actual table. 
 The data is stored in one place and the index is stored in another place. 
 Moreover, the index will have pointers to the storage location of the actual data.*/

--The Index scan retrieves all rows from the specified table. 
--Therefore, it might be suitable for small tables, but retrieving 
--all rows from that table is not optimal for SQL Server if it has a massive number of records.

/*RANK Function in SQL Server
The RANK Function in SQL Server is a kind of Ranking Function. 
This function will assign the number to each row within the partition of an output. 
It assigns the rank to each row as one plus the previous row rank.
When the RANK function finds two values that are identical within the same partition, 
it assigns them with the same rank number. 
In addition, the next number in the ranking will be the previous rank plus duplicate numbers. 
Therefore, this function does not always assign the ranking of rows in consecutive order.
The RANK function is also a sub-part of window functions. 
The following points should be remembered while using this function:
It always works with the OVER() clause.
It assigns a rank to each row based on the ORDER BY clause.
It assigns a rank to each row in consecutive order.
It always assigns a rank to rows, starting with one for each new partition.*/

--RANK() Function
--This function is used to determine the rank for each row in the result set.
--skips the rank - likerank system in schools

FROM batch35; 

--PARTITION BY CLAUSE
SELECT empname,designation,salary,
RANK () OVER (partition by designation ORDER BY salary desc) AS Rank_No   
FROM batch35; 

/*In the above example
The OVER clause sets the partitioning and ordering of a result before the associated window function is applied.
The PARTITION BY clause divides the output produces by the FROM clause into the partition. 
Then the function is applied to each partition and re-initialized when the division border crosses partitions. 
If we have not defined this clause, the function will treat all rows as a single partition.
The ORDER BY is a required clause that determines the order of the rows in a descending or ascending manner
based on one or more column names before the function is applied.*/

 /*ROW_NUMBER() Function
This function is used to return the unique sequential number for each row within its partition. 
The row numbering begins at one and increases by one until the partition's total number of rows is reached.
It will return the different ranks for the row having similar values that make it different from the RANK() function.*/

/*DENSE_RANK() Function
This function assigns a unique rank for each row within a partition as per the specified column value without any gaps. 
It always specifies ranking in consecutive order. 
If we get a duplicate value, this function will assign it with the same rank, and the next rank being the next sequential number.
This characteristic differs DENSE_RANK() function from the RANK() function. */

/*NTILE(N) Function
This function is used to distribute rows of an ordered partition into a pre-defined number (N) of approximately equal groups. 
Each row group gets its rank based on the defined condition and starts numbering from one group. 
It assigns a bucket number for every row in a group representing the group to which it belongs.*/
