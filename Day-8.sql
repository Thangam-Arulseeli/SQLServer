/*Introduction SQL Server MERGE Statement
Suppose, you have two table called source and target tables, and you need to update the 
target table based on the values matched from the source table. There are three cases:
The source table has some rows that do not exist in the target table.
In this case, you need to insert rows that are in the source table into the target table.
The target table has some rows that do not exist in the source table. 
In this case, you need to delete rows from the target table.
The source table has some rows with the same keys as the rows in the target table. 
However, these rows have different values in the non-key columns. 
In this case, you need to update the rows in the target table with the values coming from the source table.*/

/*If you use the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statement individually, you have to construct three separate statements to update the data to the target table with the matching rows from the source table.
However, SQL Server provides the MERGE statement that allows you to perform three actions at the same time. 
The following shows the syntax of the MERGE statement:*/

/*
What are the differences between Inline and Multi-Statement Table-Valued Functions in SQL Server?
In an Inline Table-Valued Function, the returns clause cannot define the structure of the table that the function is going to return whereas in the Multi-Statement Table-Valued Function the returns clause defines the structure of the table that the function is going to return.
The Inline Table-Valued Function cannot have BEGIN and END blocks whereas the Multi-Statement Table-Valued Function has the Begin and End blocks.
It is possible to update the underlying database table using the inline table-valued function but it is not possible to update the underlying database table using the multi-statement table-valued function.
Inline Table-Valued functions are better for performance than the Multi-Statement Table-Valued function. So, if the given task can be achieved using an Inline Table-Valued Function, then it is always preferred to use Inline Table-valued Function over the Multi-Statement Table-Valued function.
Reason For Better Performance: Internally SQL Server treats an Inline Table-Valued function much like a view and treats a Multi-Statement Table-Valued function as a stored procedure.*/

--Update underlying database table using the inline table-valued function in SQL Server

SELECT * FROM dbo.ILTVF_GetWorker()

--For the above function, Employee is the underlying database table.

UPDATE ILTVF_GetWorker() SET FIRST_NAME='Monika' WHERE WORKER_ID= 1

/*
What is the Difference Between Functions and Procedures in SQL Server?
A function must return a value, it is mandatory whereas a procedure returning a value is optional.
The procedure can have parameters of both input and output whereas a function can have only input parameters.
In a procedure, we can perform Select. Update, Insert and Delete operations whereas function can only be used to perform select operations. It cannot be used to perform Insert, Update, and Delete operations that can change the state of the database.
A procedure provides the options to perform Transaction Management, Error Handling, etc whereas these operations are not possible in a function.
We call a procedure using EXECUTE/ EXEC command whereas a function is called by using SELECT command only.
From a procedure, we can call another procedure or a function whereas from a function we can call another function but not a procedure.
User-Defined Functions can be used in the SQL statements anywhere in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section where as Stored procedures cannot be.*/

In 1986, SQL was approved by ANSI (American national Standards Institute) and in 1987, it was approved by ISO (International Standards Organization).
SQL is a structure query language which is a common database language for all RDBMS products. Different RDBMS product vendors have developed their own database language by extending SQL for their own RDBMS products.

--STORED PROCEDURES

--The MS SQL Server Stored procedure is used to save time to write code again and again 
--by storing the same in database and also get the required output by passing parameters.

/*A stored procedure is a group of one or more pre-compiled SQL statements into a logical unit.
 It is stored as an object inside the database server. 
 It is a subroutine or a subprogram in the common computing language that has been created and stored in the database. 
 Each procedure in SQL Server always contains a name, parameter lists, and Transact-SQL statements. 
 The SQL Database Server stores the stored procedures as named objects. 
SYNTAX:
CREATE PROCEDURE [schema_name].procedure_name  
                @parameter_name data_type,   
                ....   
                parameter_name data_type  
AS  
   BEGIN  
      -- SQL statements  
      -- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement  
   END  */

--SQL Server builds an execution plan when the stored procedure is called the first time and stores them in the cache memory. 
--The plan is reused by SQL Server in subsequent executions of the stored procedure, allowing it to run quickly and efficiently.

/*Features of Stored Procedures in SQL Server
The following are the features of stored procedure in SQL Server:
Reduced Traffic: A stored procedure reduces network traffic between the application and the database server, resulting in increased performance. It is because instead of sending several SQL statements, the application only needs to send the name of the stored procedure and its parameters.
Stronger Security: The procedure is always secure because it manages which processes and activities we can perform. It removes the need for permissions to be granted at the database object level and simplifies the security layers.
Reusable: Stored procedures are reusable. It reduces code inconsistency, prevents unnecessary rewrites of the same code, and makes the code transparent to all applications or users.
Easy Maintenance: The procedures are easier to maintain without restarting or deploying the application.
Improved Performance: Stored Procedure increases the application performance. Once we create the stored procedures and compile them the first time, it creates an execution plan reused for subsequent executions. The procedure is usually processed quicker because the query processor does not have to create a new plan.
Types of Stored Procedures
SQL Server categorizes the stored procedures mainly in two types:
User-defined Stored Procedures
System Stored Procedures*/

--Example:
select * from onlinecustomers;
ALTER PROCEDURE sp_onlinecustomers 
AS  
BEGIN  
    SELECT customerid,customername,customercity 
	FROM onlinecustomers 
    ORDER BY customercity desc;  
END;   

exec sp_onlinecustomers;

/*SET NOCOUNT ON in Stored Procedure
In some cases, we use the SET NOCOUNT ON statement in the stored procedure. 
This statement prevents the message that displays the number of rows affected by SQL queries from being shown. 
NOCOUNT denotes that the count is turned off. 
It means that if SET NOCOUNT ON is set, no message would appear indicating the number of rows affected.*/

SELECT * FROM sys.procedures;  

--Input Parameters in Stored Procedure

BEGIN   
  SELECT customerid,customername,customercity 
	FROM onlinecustomers 
    WHERE customercity=@city;

--int res=add(10);
--cout<<res;
--}

-- Declare an Int Variable that corresponds to the Output parameter in SP  
DECLARE @Total INT   
  
-- Don't forget to use the keyword OUTPUT  
EXEC sp_ordertotal @Total OUTPUT  
  
-- Print the result  
PRINT @Total  

ALTER PROCEDURE sp_name_city @name varchar(30), @city varchar(30)
AS
SELECT * FROM onlinecustomers WHERE customername=@name OR customercity=@city

EXEC sp_name_city 'Stella', 'New York'
--or
EXEC sp_name_city @name='Edward',@city= 'Phoenix'

--Temporary Stored Procedure
--We can create temporary procedures in the same way as we can create temporary tables.
-- The tempdb database is used to create these procedures. 
--We can divide the temporary procedures into two types:

--Local Temporary Stored Procedures
--Global Temporary Procedures.

ALTER PROCEDURE #Temp  
AS  
BEGIN  
PRINT 'Local temp procedure'  
END  

exec #Temp 
ALTER PROCEDURE ##TEMP  
AS  
BEGIN  
PRINT 'Global temp procedure'  
END  

exec ##Temp 

CREATE TABLE ##GlobalTemp
(
 UserID int,
 Name varchar(50), 
 Address varchar(150)
)

CREATE TABLE #LocalTemp
(
 UserID int,
 Name varchar(50), 
 Address varchar(150)
)

/*Disadvantages of Stored Procedures
The following are the limitations of stored procedures in SQL Server:
Debugging: Since debugging stored procedures is never simple, it is not advised to write and execute complex business logic using them. As a result, if we will not handle it properly, it can result in a failure.
Dependency: As we know, professional DBAs and database developers handle vast data sets in large organizations. And the application developers must depend on them because any minor changes must be referred to a DBA, who can fix bugs in existing procedures or build new ones.
Expensive: Stored procedures are costly to manage in terms of DBAs because organizations would have to pay extra costs for specialist DBAs. A DBA is much more qualified to handle complex database procedures.
Specific to a Vendor: Stored procedures written in one platform cannot run on another. Since procedures written in Oracle are more complicated, we will need to rewrite the entire procedure for SQL Server.
