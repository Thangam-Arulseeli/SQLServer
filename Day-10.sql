/*A SUBQUERY is a SQL query within a SQL statement.
 A subquery can be part of a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement and is itself always a SELECT query. 
 It is also possible for a subquery to have another subquery within it. 
 A subquery within a subquery is called a NESTED SUBQUERY and the phenomenon is called NESTING. 
 SQL Server supports 32 levels of nesting i.e. 32 subqueries in a statement. 
 A SUBQUERY is also called an INNER QUERY or INNER SELECT and the main SQL statement 
 of which it is a part and which it feeds with data is called the OUTER QUERY or MAIN QUERY.*/

--Subquery
--When a query is included inside another query, the Outer query is known as Main Query, and Inner query is known as Subquery.
--Nested Query �
--In Nested Query,  Inner query runs first, and only once. 
--Outer query is executed with result from Inner query.
--Hence, Inner query is used in execution of Outer query.

--There are mainly two types of nested queries:

/*Independent Nested Queries: In independent nested queries, query execution starts from innermost query to outermost queries. 
The execution of inner query is independent of outer query, but the result of inner query is used in execution of outer query.
Various operators like IN, NOT IN, ANY, ALL etc are used in writing independent nested queries.*/ --(3,7)
