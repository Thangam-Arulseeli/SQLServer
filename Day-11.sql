/*Pivot and Unpivot in SQL
In SQL, Pivot and Unpivot are relational operators that are used 
to transform one table into another in order to achieve more simpler view of table. 
Conventionally we can say that Pivot operator converts the rows
data of the table into the column data. 
The Unpivot operator does the opposite that is it transform the column based data into rows.*/

Create Table course

CourseName nvarchar(50) primary key, 
CourseCategory nvarchar(50),
Price int

Insert into course  values('C', 'PROGRAMMING', 5000) 
Insert into course  values('JAVA', 'PROGRAMMING', 6000) 
Insert into course  values('PYTHON', 'PROGRAMMING', 8000) 
Insert into course  values('C#', 'PROGRAMMING', 8000) 
Insert into course  values('SQL', 'RDBMS', 8000) 
Insert into course  values('ORACLE', 'RDBMS', 8000)

/*The Common Table Expressions (CTE) were introduced into standard SQL in order to simplify various classes of SQL Queries for which a derived table was just unsuitable. 
CTE was introduced in SQL Server 2005, the common table expression (CTE) is a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 
You can also use a CTE in a CREATE a view, as part of the view�s SELECT query. In addition, as of SQL Server 2008, you can add a CTE to the new MERGE statement.
Using the CTE �
We can define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly before SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE statement. 
The WITH clause can include one or more CTEs seperated by commas. */

/*Why do we need CTE?
Like database views and derived tables, CTEs can make it easier to write and manage complex queries by making them more readable and simple. 
We can accomplish this characteristic by breaking down the complex queries into simple blocks that can reuse in rewriting the query.
Some of its use cases are given below:
It is useful when we need to define a derived table multiple times within a single query.
It is useful when we need to create an alternative to a view in the database.
It is useful when we need to perform the same calculation multiple times on multiple query components simultaneously.
It is useful when we need to use ranking functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and NTILE().
Some of its advantages are given below:
CTE facilitates code maintenance easier.
CTE increases the readability of the code.
It increases the performance of the query.
CTE makes it possible to implement recursive queries easily.
Types of CTE in SQL Server
SQL Server divides the CTE (Common Table Expressions) into two broad categories:
Recursive CTE- query that calls itself
Non-Recursive CTE-doesn't reference itself*/

/*The following are the limitations of using CTE in SQL Server:
CTE members are unable to use the keyword clauses like Distinct, Group By, Having, Top, Joins, etc.
The CTE can only be referenced once by the Recursive member.
We cannot use the table variables and CTEs as parameters in stored procedures.
We already know that the CTE could be used in place of a view, but a CTE cannot be nested, while Views can.
Since it's just a shortcut for a query or subquery, it can't be reused in another query.
The number of columns in the CTE arguments and the number of columns in the query must be the same.*/
